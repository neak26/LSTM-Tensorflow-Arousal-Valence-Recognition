# LSTM-Tensorflow-Arousal-Valence-Recognition
Similar idea with [1], that is emotion dimension classification using SEMAINE [2] dataset. The dataset used here is created 
by extracting the facial features from videos by using Affdex [3]. The data is labeled by using the annatotions from SEMAINE
website. The average of all annatotors was calculated for each user, then the classes were created by over average (high) and 
under average (low) for arousal and valence scales.
